# ChessMixed

## About

For my Project #2, I'll be laying the CRUD foundation for an app called ChessMixed that I've had for a while, but haven't come close to being able to implement until now. For now, I'll be focusing on basic single user functionality, w/ an ambitious stretch goal to implement a 1v1 mode.

 *(The reason for the title "ChessMixed" will not be obvious until much later steps than for project week, but basically, I eventually want to build and app where you can play **Normal** chess OR **Wacky** chess with special player "powers" and random boardwide "events")*
